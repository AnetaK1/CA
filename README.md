# Project Name
> CA - Cellural automata

## General info
Cellural automata is represented by grid of cells. \
Cell have: position on grid like x and y coordinate, state: alive or dead,color. White color means that cell is dead.\
Nucleation means the initial distribution of cells on the grid. There are: homogenous, random, with Radius and clicking.
Boundary condition: absorbic, periodic. They describe how cells will behave on the edges of the grid.\
Transition rules denote how the state of a cell changes.\
There are rules: vonNeumann, Moore, pentagonal, heksagonal.\
Monte carlo is used to smooth the edges between cells.\
You can choose how big can be grid and cell.

## Inspiration
Project was done as part of classes of multiscale modeling.
