# Project Name
> CA - Cellural automata

## General info
Cellural automata is represented by grid of cells. \
Cell have: 
* position on grid like x and y coordinate, 
* state: alive or dead,
* color; white color means that cell is dead.\

Nucleation means the initial distribution of cells on the grid.\
There are: 
* homogenous, 
* random, 
* with Radius, 
* clicking.

Boundary conditions describe how cells will behave on the edges of the grid. There are: aborbic and periodic.\

Transition rules denote how the state of a cell changes.\
There are rules:
* vonNeumann, 
* Moore,
* pentagonal, 
* heksagonal.\

Monte carlo is used to smooth the edges between cells.\

You can choose how big can be grid and cell.

## Inspiration
Project was done as part of classes of multiscale modeling.
